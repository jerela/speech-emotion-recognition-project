# speech-emotion-recognition-project
 
This is my project from the "Machine Learning for Speech" course I took in 2022. I tested different classifiers for detecting three different classes of human emotion from audio samples of speech in different languages.

The abstract of **report.pdf** describes the project:
>In this project, a combined dataset comprising data from six individual speech emotion recognition datasets is constructed. After pre-processing steps, 28 features are extracted per waveform. Supervised learning models are trained with five different classifier algorithms to predict the emotion label of audio waveforms in three classes: anger, happiness, and sadness. Neural network and support vector machine-based models performed the best among the tested algorithms with mean classification accuracies of 0.5837 and 0.5571 over six test sets, respectively. Although the models were capable of inter-language emotion recognition to some extent, accuracy in general was low and most likely attributed to suboptimal selection of audio features and classifier model hyperparameters. Several potential improvements to the workflow are presented but were not implemented in this project due to time constraints.
